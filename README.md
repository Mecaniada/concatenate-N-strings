# concatenate-N-strings
This is made based on exercise "81. Write a Python program to concatenate N strings." from https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/python-basic-exercises.php . I've made this code by myself just to play and have a better understanding when it cames to python programming. 
This program makes a list based on the input and removes all of the blankspaces even if it's a sentence or a word. After this was done you can write "conc" in the terminal so that the program will return a concatenated string. I addition to this based on my program or yours you can extend the program futher.
Proposed ideas: sort the list, save a list and make another so you can make addition or difference, pop an item etc
